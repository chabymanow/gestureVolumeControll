Volume controll with hand gesture
---

This python program watching your tips of the thumb and the finger printer and check the distance between the two point and draw a line between these two points. The length of this line gives the lebel of the volume.

In the code, you can change everything. Basically the program draws the line between the two points but you can delete it or you can draw all the lines for the hand and fingers.

The program also writes out the current volume settings and a volume bar in blue colour. Of course you can change it or delete it.

This program working only on windows. When you run this program first time, you need to run the setup first. For this, you need to delete the comment mark from the **line 17**
`# linearwinvolume.setup()`
This is the setup, it needs to run only one time, after that, you can comment it out again.

TODO list:
* need to improve the line drawing
* need to implement the watching which hand is in the video and watching only one hand.
* implement a gesture which start the volume setting and an another which stop the volume setting
